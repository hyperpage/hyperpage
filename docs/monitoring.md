## Performance Thresholds

### Default Configuration
```typescript
const thresholds = {
  maxResponseTimeMs: { p95: 500, p99: 2000 },
  maxErrorRate: 5.0,        // 5%
  minCacheHitRate: 70.0,    // 70%
  maxMemoryUsage: 85.0,     // 85%
  minCompressionRatio: 40.0, // 40%
  maxBatchDurationMs: 10000, // 10 seconds
};
```

### Alert Conditions
- **Critical**: P99 response time > 2000ms, Resource exhaustion
- **Warning**: P95 response time > 500ms, Error rate > 5%, Cache hit rate < 70%
- **Info**: Compression ratio < 40%, Low efficiency indicators
