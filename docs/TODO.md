# Rate Limiting Avoidance - Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the detailed implementation tasks needed to prevent rate limiting issues from external platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, etc.) in Hyperpage.

## 🎯 Task Overview

Based on the analysis of the current codebase, the following categories of improvements are needed:
- Platform-aware error handling and retry logic
- Dynamic polling frequency management
- Intelligent caching strategies
- Rate limit monitoring and user feedback
- Request deduplication and optimization

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### 10. Rate Limiting Test Suite

**Priority: Medium** | **Effort: High** | **Duration: 4-5 hours**

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Create mock rate limiting server for testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for backoff/retry logic
- [ ] Integration tests for dynamic polling behavior
- [ ] End-to-end tests for rate limit UI feedback
- [ ] Performance tests with simulated high-frequency scenarios

#### Test Files:
- `__tests__/lib/rate-limit-utils.test.ts`
- `__tests__/integration/rate-limiting.test.ts`
- `__tests__/e2e/rate-limit-handling.spec.ts`

### 11. Observability & Monitoring

**Priority: Low** | **Effort: Medium** | **Duration: 2-3 hours**

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] Add rate limit metrics to existing health endpoint
- [ ] Create Prometheus metrics for API usage tracking
- [ ] Log rate limiting events for debugging
- [ ] Add dashboard for monitoring API performance across platforms

## 🔍 Success Metrics

Monitor these indicators to validate improvements:

- **API Error Rate**: Target <1% rate limiting errors
- **Data Freshness**: Average delay <30 seconds for critical data
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduce manual refresh frequency by 80%
- **Platform Coverage**: Support intelligent handling for all major platforms

---

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

**High Risk**:
- Breaking existing API integrations
- Over-caching leading to stale data
- Complex retry logic introducing race conditions

**Medium Risk**:
- Dynamic polling complexity
- Platform-specific edge cases

**Low Risk**:
- User preference UI
- Monitoring/metrics additions
