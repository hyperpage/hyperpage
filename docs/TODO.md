- [ ] Create test reporting and monitoring
- [ ] Implement automated test execution triggers
- [ ] Document integration testing procedures

### Phase 7: Documentation & Maintenance
- [ ] Create integration testing documentation
- [ ] Establish test maintenance procedures
- [ ] Document troubleshooting guides for test failures
- [ ] Create developer onboarding for integration testing

## Test Implementation Summary

### GitHub Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/tools/github.spec.ts`)
- **21 comprehensive tests** covering pull requests, issues, workflows, and rate limiting
- **Advanced features**: Request deduplication, OAuth integration, performance monitoring
- **Security validation**: Session isolation, API token protection, endpoint security
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios and recovery testing

### GitLab Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/tools/gitlab.spec.ts`)
- **25 comprehensive tests** covering merge requests, pipelines, issues, rate limiting
- **Multi-instance support**: Cloud and self-hosted GitLab instances
- **Concurrent request handling**: Advisory locking, caching strategies
- **API rate limiting**: Intelligent backoff and retry mechanisms

### Jira Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/tools/jira.spec.ts`)
- **15 comprehensive tests** covering issues, projects, changelogs with JQL support
- **Batch processing**: Multi-issue changelog fetching with validation
- **Caching strategy**: 24-hour caching with advisory locking
- **Connectivity**: IPv4 fixes and timeout handling

### Cross-Tool Aggregation Tests (`__tests__/integration/tools/cross-tool-aggregation.spec.ts`)
- **6 specialized tests** for unified data format and multi-tool coordination
- **Unified data format**: Consistent ticket numbering across tools
- **Multi-tool coordination**: Parallel data fetching and aggregation
- **Rate limiting**: Cross-platform rate limiting coordination
- **Security validation**: Session isolation and data leakage prevention

### Integration Test Infrastructure
- **Shared test environment**: `IntegrationTestEnvironment` with mock OAuth handling
- **Credential management**: `OAuthTestCredentials` with provider-specific tokens
- **Session management**: Proper session creation, cleanup, and isolation
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with proper error handling
- **Consistent patterns**: Uniform test structure across all integration suites

### Test Execution Results
- âœ… **All 67 tests compile successfully** (no TypeScript errors)
- âœ… **Test structure properly implemented** with shared infrastructure
- âœ… **All test categories represented** (GitHub: 21, GitLab: 25, Jira: 15, Cross-tool: 6)
- âœ… **Expected runtime failures** (connection refused - server not running)

### Workflow Testing Suite (`__tests__/integration/workflows/`)
- **56 comprehensive end-to-end tests** covering complete user workflows
- **5 specialized test suites**: User journeys, session management, rate limiting, error recovery, orchestration
- **Mock infrastructure**: Sophisticated browser and API simulation patterns
- **Test utilities**: TestBrowser and UserJourneySimulator for realistic workflow simulation
