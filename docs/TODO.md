- [ ] **Implement basic OpenBao integration** - Docker container setup with minimal API
- [ ] **Implement GitHub Actions workflow** - Secret injection demonstration
- [ ] **Create secret flow demonstration** - Store → TCS → runtime consumers flow
- [ ] **Document PoC results** - Screenshots, validation, and findings

### Phase 2: ADR Stakeholder Sign-offs (HIGH PRIORITY)

## Work Required

**Estimated Effort**: 20-24 hours total (10 hours PoC + 8 hours sign-offs + 6 hours final docs)

**Critical Path Items**:
1. **Proof-of-Concept** (blocking for exit criteria validation)
2. **Stakeholder sign-offs** (blocking for Phase 01)
3. **Final documentation** (enabling smooth Phase 01 transition)

**Completion Priority**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Proof-of-Concept implementation (10 hours)
2. **CRITICAL**: ADR stakeholder reviews (8 hours)
3. **HIGH**: Final integration and handoff (6 hours)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate (Next 2 hours)**: Begin proof-of-concept development
2. **Today**: Complete PoC with basic integrations
3. **Tomorrow**: Schedule and conduct stakeholder ADR reviews
4. **End of week**: Final integration and Phase 01 handoff
