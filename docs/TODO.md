- **API Endpoints**: Sub-100ms response times for all operations
- **Test Coverage**: 92% with 222 passing tests

### 🔧 **Optimization Targets**
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Advanced indexing and query planning
- [ ] **Memory Management**: Connection pooling and cache eviction strategies
- [ ] **Background Job Scaling**: Concurrent processing and queue optimization
- [ ] **API Performance**: Request batching and response compression
- [ ] **Monitoring & Analytics**: Real-time performance dashboards

### 🎛️ **Enterprise Scaling Features**
- [ ] **Horizontal Pod Scaling**: Load balancing and session management
- [ ] **Database Read Replicas**: WAL-mode replication for read scaling
- [ ] **Multi-region Deployment**: Cross-region data synchronization
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Advanced monitoring and bottleneck identification

### ✅ **Business Impact**
The optimization phase will elevate Hyperpage from "production-ready" to "enterprise-scale," capable of handling millions of requests with sub-second response times and 99.9% uptime.
