# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements and future development directions for Hyperpage.

## Production Readiness

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. **Caching Layer**: Redis-based data caching for high-performance scalability
2. **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API quota management and abuse protection
3. **Background Processing**: Queued job execution for heavy operations

### Medium Priority
4. **Authentication System**: OAuth integration for secure tool access
5. **Workspace Management**: Multiple portal configurations and multi-project support
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting for production operations

## Advanced Features

### Future Considerations
7. **Advanced Analytics**: Deeper insights and reporting capabilities
8. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile portal access
9. **Plugin Architecture**: Third-party extension support
10. **Background Processing**: Enhanced async job execution for heavy computations

## Completed Features

### Core Architecture
- ✅ **Registry-Driven Integration**: Complete tool abstraction and discovery system
- ✅ **Security Architecture**: Server-side credential isolation audited and verified
- ✅ **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, and optimized component rendering
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with zero `any` types
- ✅ **Extensibility**: New tools integrate with zero code changes or configuration updates

### Activity & Content Systems
- ✅ **Enhanced Activity Feed**: Rich content cards showing commit messages, issue descriptions, and comments with color-coded visualization
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Commit Integration**: GitHub and GitLab commit messages via Compare APIs
- ✅ **Jira ATF Parsing**: Automatic extraction of descriptions from Atlassian Document Format
- ✅ **Unified Ticketing System**: Aggregates issues/tickets from multiple tools (Jira, GitLab, GitHub)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Repository Coverage**: Activities from owned repositories, collaborator access, and organization memberships for full visibility

### Quality & Testing
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing with Docker isolation (69/69 tests passing)
- ✅ **E2E Test Infrastructure**: Docker-based browser testing with isolated environments
- ✅ **Dead Code Elimination**: Removed 4 unused components (~200 lines) - ChartWidget, DashboardSearchResults, MetricCard, Sidebar
- ✅ **Major Code Cleanup**: 41% ESLint issue reduction, 0 TypeScript errors, framework conflicts resolved
- ✅ **Production-Ready Testing**: Zero regressions, 100% test success rate with robust error handling

### Professional Design System
- ✅ **Enterprise-Grade Typography**: Inter font system with professional hierarchy and line spacing
- ✅ **Dark Mode Implementation**: Full light/dark theme switching with proper contrast ratios
- ✅ **OKLCH Color Palette**: Sophisticated 12-step neutral scale for professional appearance
- ✅ **Consistent Spacing System**: Unified 24-step spacing scale across all components
- ✅ **Elevation System**: Shadow hierarchy providing modern depth and visual structure
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with enterprise-grade breakpoints

## Timeline

**Late Q4 2025**: Production readiness features (caching, rate limiting, authentication system)
**Q1 2026**: Advanced monitoring, workspace management, and analytics capabilities
**Q2 2026**: Mobile application and plugin architecture
**Q3 2026**: Advanced analytics and mobile application features
