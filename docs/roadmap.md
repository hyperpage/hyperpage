# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned enhancements and future development directions for Hyperpage.

## Planned Enhancements

### Production Readiness
- **Authentication System**: OAuth integration for secure tool access
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Workspace Management**: Multiple dashboard configurations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting

### Scalability Improvements
- **Caching Layer**: Redis-based data caching for high-performance
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent API quota management
- **Background Processing**: Queued job execution for heavy operations
- **Monitoring**: Application performance and health tracking

## Architectural Strengths
- ✅ **Registry-Driven**: Complete tool abstraction and discovery
- ✅ **Security**: Server-side credential isolation audited and verified
- ✅ **Performance**: Optimized component rendering and data fetching
- ✅ **Extensibility**: New tools integrate with zero code changes
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with zero `any` types
