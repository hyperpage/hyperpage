# Phase 8: Tool Integration Expansion

## Overview

This phase expands the existing tool integration tests, adds comprehensive API endpoint testing, creates tool workflow validation suites, and enhances multi-tool orchestration testing.

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Enhanced API Endpoint Testing
- Comprehensive test coverage for all tool API endpoints
- API contract validation and schema testing
- Error handling and edge case testing for all endpoints
- Performance testing for API endpoints under load

### 2. Tool Workflow Validation Suites
- End-to-end workflow testing for each tool integration
- Data transformation accuracy verification
- Multi-step workflow validation across tools
- Workflow error recovery and fallback testing

### 3. Multi-Tool Orchestration Testing
- Cross-tool data aggregation validation
- Tool synchronization and consistency testing
- Multi-tool workflow orchestration testing
- Tool failure impact and recovery testing

### 4. Tool Integration Expansion
- New tool integration test frameworks
- Plugin architecture testing for extensibility
- Tool configuration validation testing
- Tool capability detection and fallback testing

## Success Criteria

### Tool Integration Goals
- [ ] **100% API endpoint coverage** for all supported tools
- [ ] **Complete workflow validation** for all tool integrations
- [ ] **Cross-tool orchestration** testing for all scenarios
- [ ] **Tool expansion framework** ready for new integrations
