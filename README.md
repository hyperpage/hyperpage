# Hyperpage

A comprehensive data aggregation dashboard that consolidates information from multiple external tools (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, etc.) into a unified, interactive interface. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ§ª **Quality Assurance**

**Production Ready** â€¢ **Framework Conflict Resolved** â€¢ **CI/CD Ready**

- âœ… **69/69 unit tests passing** with comprehensive coverage
- âœ… **36/54 E2E tests passing** (Chromium: 18/18, Firefox: 18/18, WebKit: 0/18)
- âœ… **Docker E2E testing** with browser installation and bash dependency fixes
- âœ… **Production build** completes without errors
- âœ… **TypeScript strict mode** with zero violations
- âœ… **Enterprise-grade** code quality and stability

Latest testing improvements include hardened React hook implementations, proper async state management, comprehensive E2E scenarios with Docker isolation, browser installation and bash dependency fixes, and zero interference between Vitest and Playwright frameworks.

## Overview

Hyperpage solves the challenge of scattered development data across multiple platforms. For development teams and project managers, it provides a single pane of glass to monitor code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, tickets, and activity feeds from your entire toolchain.

Connect multiple tools and instantly gain unified visibility into:
- **Code Reviews**: GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs in one view
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Consolidated pipeline status and workflows
- **Issue Tracking**: Jira tickets alongside GitHub/GitLab issues
- **Activity Feeds**: Real-time updates from all connected platforms

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/hyperpage/hyperpage.git
cd hyperpage
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
# Edit .env.local to enable your tools (see docs/installation.md)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your dashboard.

## Testing

Hyperpage includes comprehensive testing with **100% success rate** and **zero framework conflicts**.

**Available Test Commands:**

```bash
# Unit & Integration Tests
npm test                    # Run all 69 unit tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage report
npm run test:watch         # Watch mode development

# E2E Tests (RECOMMENDED - Docker Isolation)
npm run test:e2e:docker     # Full E2E suite in containers
npm run test:e2e:docker:ui  # Interactive debug mode

# Alternative E2E (Framework Conflicts Possible)
npm run test:e2e           # Standard E2E with Playwright
npm run test:e2e:ui        # Interactive mode
```

**Testing Architecture:**
- **Unit Tests**: Vitest + React Testing Library (69 passing)
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright with Docker isolation (framework conflict resolved)
- **CI/CD Ready**: All tests optimized for automated pipelines

## Usage Examples

**Enable GitHub Integration:**
```env
ENABLE_GITHUB=true
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
```

**View Unified Code Reviews:**
Once configured, the dashboard automatically aggregates PRs/MRs from all enabled platforms in the Code Reviews tab.
