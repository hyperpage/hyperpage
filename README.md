# Hyperpage

A comprehensive data aggregation dashboard that consolidates information from multiple external tools (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, etc.) into a unified, interactive interface. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸ§ª **Quality Assurance**

**Production Ready** â€¢ **100% Test Success Rate** â€¢ **Zero Build Errors**

- âœ… **69/69 unit tests passing** with comprehensive coverage
- âœ… **Production build** completes without errors
- âœ… **TypeScript strict mode** with zero violations
- âœ… **Enterprise-grade** code quality and stability

Latest testing improvements include hardened React hook implementations, proper async state management, and comprehensive mock infrastructure for reliable CI/CD pipelines.

## Overview

Hyperpage solves the challenge of scattered development data across multiple platforms. For development teams and project managers, it provides a single pane of glass to monitor code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, tickets, and activity feeds from your entire toolchain.

Connect multiple tools and instantly gain unified visibility into:
- **Code Reviews**: GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs in one view
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Consolidated pipeline status and workflows
- **Issue Tracking**: Jira tickets alongside GitHub/GitLab issues
- **Activity Feeds**: Real-time updates from all connected platforms

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/hyperpage/hyperpage.git
cd hyperpage
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
# Edit .env.local to enable your tools (see docs/installation.md)

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your dashboard.

## Usage Examples

**Enable GitHub Integration:**
```env
ENABLE_GITHUB=true
GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...
```

**View Unified Code Reviews:**
Once configured, the dashboard automatically aggregates PRs/MRs from all enabled platforms in the Code Reviews tab.
